# Add picture boxes in random locations and click to remove them

Hi Welcome to another Windows form application and C# programming tutorial. In this tutorial we will explore how to make a windows form application that will spawn a picture box on the form every second and then it will be linked to a click event which will trigger when the user clicks on it. Once the picture box is clicked it will be removed from the form. This is a useful method for games such as when you want to drop an item or spawn enemies and remove them from the game when they no longer needed. This app will use the click events to control the other picture boxes. In the next one we will show how to do one where you can move your own player picture box and collect them on the form.



    Create a simple application in Visual Studio Using Windows Form Application framework
    Randomly assign X and Y values to the picture boxes
    Dynamically spawn picture boxes with its own properties in the windows form application
    Dynamically assign CLICK event to the picture box
    CLICK to remove the picture box
    Add the picture boxes to LISTS and keep track of how many picture boxes are on the form at a time
